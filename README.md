Analyze 2022 SPARCS data through stats and visuals to explore healthcare trends, patient demographics, and hospital performance.
## Summary Report:

The average length of stay was 1.33. Regarding how the total cost varies by age group or type of admission, I found that between Ages 1 and 17, the admission costs were $330.937. With the admission trend, I found that admissions of newborns were 2 and urgent was 1. I had problems with creating a bar plot for types of admission to analyze admission trends such as emergency, elective, and trauma.
